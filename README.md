# Contrail segmentation project
This is a project from a kaggle competition (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/google-research-identify-contrails-reduce-global-warming).
The subject of the competition was to identify condensation trails on satellite images left by airplanes in order to reduce atmospheric heat which contributes to global warming.
